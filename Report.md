Student, <br><br>
Hi, I am getting the following error after running tests on the sort method within the Arrays.java file. The sort method is supposed to sort the given array in ascending order. The failure induing input is {3,4,5,6,1,2}. I think the error is in the implementation of the sort method but I am not able to find where exactly.
